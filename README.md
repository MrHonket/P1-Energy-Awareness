# P1-Energy-Awareness
P1 projekt p√• AAU 2019  om Energy Awareness

Abstract:
This report focuses on the subject of "energy price awareness" and how the societal transition from non-renewable energy sources to renewable energy sources can be supported by changing the habits of electricity consumers. We argue that this habit change can be encouraged by informing the consumer about possibilities of saving money spent on electricity in their household. This information is provided via a small program, coded in C, which focuses on how the users can save money in their daily power consumption by postponing this consumption to time slots with cheaper electricity prices. The latter part of this project report describes the coding of this program in detail.
